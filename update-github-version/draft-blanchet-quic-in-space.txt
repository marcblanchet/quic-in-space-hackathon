1.  Introduction

   QUIC is a new transport bringing very interesting features that could
   enable its use in space, while TCP is not good.  However, QUIC was
   designed for terrestrial Internet, which brings assumptions on
   typical delays and connectivity.  In (deep) space, delays are much
   larger, in order of minutes (4-20 minutes to Mars), and long
   disruptions, such as because of orbital mechanics, in order minutes
   or hours or days.

   It may be possible to modify the base behavior of QUIC stacks to
   satisfy these requirements.  For example, several assumptions, such
   as initial delay, are just static constants in the code that could be
   externalized so they could better start the QUIC machinery in the
   context of space.

   The purpose of this document is to provide guidance for supporting
   space communication in QUIC implementations.
